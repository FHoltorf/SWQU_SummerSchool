#
# What is multiple dispatch?
# methods vs functions
# type compilation
# examples for multiple dispatch 
# -> AD? IntervalArithmetic? use dispatch to propagate uncertainty through discrete time ODE system?
# -> maybe use a little simple space weather model to do this stuff?


# The ecosystem?
# show DifferentialEquations.jl, maybe MethodOfLines.jl, maybe ModelingToolkit.jl
# show how we may solve a simple PDE? --> draw from previous examples
# show how much faster it is
# show Forward AD --> solving the stationary heat equation via shooting

# incorporating python code via PyCall
